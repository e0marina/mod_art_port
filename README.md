# mod_art_port
This is a personal project that's mostly intended to showcase my art in addition to help me continue to learn / hone my skills with development. 
It's a full stack application built with Node.js, Express.js, React.js, and MySQL/Sequelize. The Node/Express/Sequelize back end is currently in progress, while at the moment, 
the React.js front-end is fully functional. Soon, I will connect the back and front end and a user will be able to add artwork that will then populate on the front-end. 
Once this is built, I intend to do it again using Mongo/GraphQL.
